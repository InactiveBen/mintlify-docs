### Create a LocalScript
Assuming you have successfully completed the installation steps for the **Fluent Library** as outlined in the previous section, you can proceed to initialize the library by executing the following code in the terminal. This code will create a <Tooltip tip="A LocalScript is a script that runs on the client-side.">LocalScript</Tooltip> named `Fluent_Interface` within the `StarterPlayerScripts` category. 

Please ensure that you have **Roblox Studio** open and that the <Tooltip tip="You can find the Terminal under 'View' > 'Command Bar'">**command bar**</Tooltip> is accessible before executing the code:

<CodeGroup> 
```lua CreateLocalScript.lua
local StarterPlayer = game:GetService("StarterPlayer") 
local create = Instance.new("LocalScript") 
create.Name = "Fluent_Interface" 
create.Parent = StarterPlayer:WaitForChild("StarterPlayerScripts") 
``` 

</CodeGroup>
<Info>
Alternatively, you can manually create a LocalScript under the StarterPlayerScripts category. You may name it whatever you prefer, but in the documentation, it will be referred to as Fluent_Interface.
</Info>

### Create a Window

To create a window using Fluent UI, please insert the following code snippet into the <Tooltip tip="Ensure that you have a LocalScript under `StarterPlayerScripts`, referred to as `Fluent_Interface` in this example.">Fluent_Interface</Tooltip> script that you created earlier.



<CodeGroup>
```lua Window.lua
task.wait(3)
-- This script looks for the Fluent Library installed in the first step.
local Main = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Fluent:WaitForChild("MainModule"))

-- This makes the window.
local Window = Main:CreateWindow({
	Title = "Fluent " .. Main.Version,
	SubTitle = "by Zuq",
	TabWidth = 160,
	Size = UDim2.fromOffset(580, 460),
	Acrylic = true,
	Theme = "Dark" 
})
```
