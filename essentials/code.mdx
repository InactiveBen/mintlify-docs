## Getting Started
Fluent is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing developers to create beautiful and functional user interfaces with ease. Whether you're new to Lua scripting or an experienced developer, Fluent provides a straightforward approach to building your UI components.

<Warning>
  The documentation below provides instructions for installing the **Fluent Library** via the **Download Fluent** option and from the **Roblox Marketplace**. For installation using **Rojo**, it is assumed that you have a sufficient understanding of the process.
</Warning>
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to Set Up" icon="setup">
    <Accordion title="Installing Fluent Library" icon="download">
      <p>
        To install the **Fluent Library**, follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open your downloads folder on your device.</li>
        <li>Locate the <strong>fluent.rbxm</strong> file.</li>
        <li>Open your Roblox project.</li>
        <li>Drag the <strong>fluent.rbxm</strong> file into your project.</li>
        <li>Locate the folder named <strong>Fluent</strong> in your workspace.</li>
        <li>Drag the folder named <strong>Fluent</strong> into the <strong>ReplicatedStorage</strong> area.</li>
      </ol>
<Warning>
       **Warning:** Please do not edit any code in the folder, as it is a package link and will receive auto-updates when the **Fluent Library** is updated.
</Warning>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Installing from Roblox Marketplace" icon="shop">
      <p>
        To install the **Fluent Library** from the Roblox Marketplace, follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Get a copy of the asset from the Roblox Marketplace.</li>
        <li>Open your toolbox.</li>
        <li>Find your owned assets and double-click on the **Fluent Library** asset.</li>
        <li>Click "OK" when prompted.</li>
        <li>Locate the <strong>Fluent</strong> folder that was added to your workspace.</li>

    <Accordion title="Installing with Rojo" icon="code">
      <p>
        To install the **Fluent Library** using Rojo, ensure that you have Rojo installed on your machine. After that, sync the package with your project like you would normally do. If done correctly, Rojo will automatically install the **Fluent Library** for you.
      </p>
<Warning>
    **PLEASE READ THIS WARNING:** Packages installed via Rojo are not auto-updated, and Rojo is not the recommended installation method. I also update the Rojo file download every few months, rather than providing the regular updates that both the Marketplace and Library downloads receive.

### Create a LocalScript
Assuming you have successfully completed the installation steps for the **Fluent Library** as outlined in the previous section, you can proceed to initialize the library by executing the following code in the terminal. This code will create a <Tooltip tip="A LocalScript is a script that runs on the client-side.">LocalScript</Tooltip> named `Fluent_Interface` within the `StarterPlayerScripts` category. 

Please ensure that you have **Roblox Studio** open and that the <Tooltip tip="You can find the Terminal under 'View' > 'Command Bar'">**command bar**</Tooltip> is accessible before executing the code:

<CodeGroup> 
```lua CreateLocalScript.lua
local StarterPlayer = game:GetService("StarterPlayer") 
local create = Instance.new("LocalScript") 
create.Name = "Fluent_Interface" 
create.Parent = StarterPlayer:WaitForChild("StarterPlayerScripts") 
``` 

</CodeGroup>
<Info>
Alternatively, you can manually create a LocalScript under the StarterPlayerScripts category. You may name it whatever you prefer, but in the documentation, it will be referred to as Fluent_Interface.
</Info>

### Create a Window

To create a window using Fluent UI, please insert the following code snippet into the <Tooltip tip="Ensure that you have a LocalScript under `StarterPlayerScripts`, referred to as `Fluent_Interface` in this example.">Fluent_Interface</Tooltip> script that you created earlier.



<CodeGroup>
```lua Window.lua
task.wait(3)
-- This script looks for the Fluent Library installed in the first step.
local Main = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Fluent"))

-- This makes the window.
local Window = Main:CreateWindow({
	Title = "Fluent " .. Main.Version,
	SubTitle = "by Zuq",
	TabWidth = 160,
	Size = UDim2.fromOffset(580, 460),
	Acrylic = true,
	Theme = "Dark" 
})
```
</CodeGroup>
<Info> Fluent offers a diverse selection of themes to enhance your user interface. Simply edit the `Theme = "ThemeName"` to swap themes.</Info>
<Accordion title="View Themes" icon="droplet">
### Available Theme Names:
```lua
Theme = "Dark"
Theme = "Darker"
Theme = "Vynixu"
Theme = "Light"
Theme = "Aqua"
Theme = "Amethyst"
Theme = "Rose"
Theme = "Ocean Wave" 
Theme = "Sunset Glow"  
Theme = "Forest Breeze" 
Theme = "Midnight Blue" 
Theme = "Retro"  
Theme = "Autumn"  
Theme = "Cyberpunk"
```
</Accordion>




### Adding Tabs

You can add tabs to your <Tooltip tip="`Fluent_Interface` should have the window already created if you followed the steps above.">window</Tooltip> as follows:

<Info> 
You can use most icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/) by specifying them like this: `Icon = "box"`.
</Info>
<CodeGroup>
```lua Tabs.lua
local Tabs = {
    Main = Window:AddTab({ Title = "Main", Icon = "box" }),
    Settings = Window:AddTab({ Title = "Settings", Icon = "settings" })
    AnotherTab = Window:AddTab({ Title = "AnotherTab", Icon = "star" })

### Notifications

To send a <Tooltip tip="This shows an alert for the duration specified in the bottom right corner. You can have as many notifications as you want at a time; however, it is recommended to not display more than 8 simultaneously.">notification</Tooltip> follow the instructions below:


<Note>
We recommend using notifications instead of warnings and print statements, as they don't affect your game metrics when reviewing overall game performance. Notifications will alert you in the corner of your screen if something fails to run, ensuring better visibility without cluttering your logs.
</Note>
<CodeGroup>
```lua Notify.lua
Main:Notify({
	Title = "Fluent",
	Content = "The script has been loaded.",

})
```
</CodeGroup>

### Settings Tab

You can also add settings for the interface theme and toggles for acrylic and transparency:

When using Acrylic, please ensure that your graphics level is set to 8 or higher; otherwise, the effect will not be visible on the screen.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```lua InterfaceTheme.lua
local InterfaceSection = Tabs.Settings:AddSection("Interface")
InterfaceSection:AddDropdown("InterfaceTheme", {
    Title = "Theme",
    Description = "Changes the interface theme.",
    Values = Main.Themes,
    Default = Main.Theme,
    Callback = function(Value)
        Main:SetTheme(Value)
    end
    ```
```lua AcrylicToggle.lua
if Main.UseAcrylic then
    InterfaceSection:AddToggle("AcrylicToggle", {
        Title = "Acrylic",
        Description = "The blurred background requires graphic quality 8+",
        Default = Main.Acrylic,
        Callback = function(Value)
            Main:ToggleAcrylic(Value)
        end
    })
end
```
```lua TransparentToggle.lua
InterfaceSection:AddToggle("TransparentToggle", {
    Title = "Transparency",
    Description = "Makes the interface transparent.",
    Default = Main.Transparency,
    Callback = function(Value)
        Main:ToggleTransparency(Value)
    end
